# Segmentation-of-Teeth-from-Child-X-ray-Panoramic-Dental-Images

The analysis of dental x-rays is a very important and fundamental process for the
diagnosis of disease in clinical procedures. Tooth numbering is a time-consuming
routine evaluation in dental radiology. Today, dental x-rays are used for dental
diagnosis and dental treatment. For example, numbering of teeth is necessary to
identify human tooth images in routine dental procedures, maxillofacial surgical
practices, and dental generic modeling.

This project segments the teeth on the x-rays given as input using the mask-RCNN
algorithm and determines the type of tooth in order to automate the job of segmenting
and identifying the type of teeth on the x-ray, thus reduces the workload of
professionals during the examination process.
